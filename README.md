# Index Protocol

The Index Protocol is a stablecoin pegged to the NASDAQ indicator. 

It allows users from any country to invest in a decentralized blockchain currency instead of the stock market and have similar returns.

The Index Protocol also gives crypto users the ability to invest in a more stable currency, while not having to move their money off chain to the stock market.

To keep the price pegged to the NASDAQ indicator, INDX token is restructured/rebased after a specific amount of time.

During this restructure/rebase, the INDX protocol will split or merge INDX tokens based on target price of the NASDAQ and market prices of INDX token.

This restructuring of the supply of INDX tokens will influence market movements to stablize the price to the NASDAQ indicator. 

Target Price = NASDAQ indicator (14123ish) / 10,000 = $1.41 

To do(Development):
1. Set up INDX token contract. //Set up, need to restructure code.

3. Integrate oracle contract with token contracts. //Next step is to reformat code into multiple contract.
4. Add liquidity to Uniswap on Rinkeby.
5. Test.

To do(General):

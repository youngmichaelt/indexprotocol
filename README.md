# Index Protocol

The Index Protocol is a stablecoin pegged to the NASDAQ indicator. 

It allows users to invest in a blockchain currency that is decentralized and less volatile. 

INDX token is restructured/rebased after a specific amount of time, I would like to use Chainlink Keepers in the future.

During this restructure/rebase, the INDX protocol will split or merge INDX tokens based on target price of the NASDAQ and market prices of INDX token.

This restructuring of the supply of INDX token will influence market movements to stablize the price to the NASDAQ indicator. 

Target Price = NASDAQ indicator (14123ish) / 10,000 = $1.41 

To do(Development):
1. Set up INDX token contract//Mostly done, just need to add requirements and emit functions.
2. Create oracle contracts DONE.
3. Incorporate oracle data with token contracts DONE.
4. Test.

To do(General):
1. Feedback.
2. Testing with users.
3. Test gas prices.
4. Create webpage for general information.
